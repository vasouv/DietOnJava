DietOnJava
==========

DietOnJava is a desktop application built on Java/JavaFX, with which nutritionists/dietitians can create diet lists for their customers.

At version 1.0, my aim is to have the basic functionality; adding foods to corresponded meals and creating reports for customers, along with other utility functionality.

The GUI of the application has been created under the suggestions of my good friend Christos Lafkas (xlafkas@gmail.com), for whom I'm making this application.

Since I have not added a TO-DO list, it isn't easy for others to contribute to my project, maybe when I'm done with v1.0 and all the code is completed.
